What strategies have you found that work with your brain instead of against it?",

The splitting that comes with BPD can also make it hard to maintain consistent relationships, which feeds into more loneliness. Are you currently using any DBT skills to help manage these intense feelings?",

BPD can make you hyper-sensitive to any sign of rejection or abandonment, which can make you withdraw from connections even when you desperately want them. It's like being stuck between needing people intensely and being terrified of them leaving. What does the loneliness feel like when it's combined with your BPD symptoms?",
