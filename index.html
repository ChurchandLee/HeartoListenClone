"That fearfulness sounds exhausting to carry. Anxiety often stems from our mind trying to protect us, but it can become overprotective to the point where it imprisons us. What situations or thoughts seem to trigger your anxiety most? What is your mind trying to keep you safe from?",

What aspects of daily life feel most derailed by your brain's different operating system? You're not lazy or broken - your brain just processes the world differently.",

You deserve to have peace with food and your body.",

OCD often convinces us that if we just check one more time, wash our hands once more, or arrange things perfectly, then we'll finally feel safe. But that relief never seems to last, does it? What does your OCD tell you will happen if you don't complete the rituals?",

Social anxiety often stems from a deep fear of rejection or humiliation, and it can make us hyper-aware of every facial expression and tone of voice. What do you imagine people are thinking about you when you're in social situations?",

"That self-consciousness sounds so painful and limiting. Social anxiety can make us feel like we're constantly under a microscope, when in reality most people are too focused on themselves to scrutinize us as much as we fear. What would social interactions feel like if you knew for certain that people weren't judging you?"

What happens when you allow yourself to stim or engage in your natural patterns? Sometimes embracing our authentic autistic traits can actually reduce anxiety and improve wellbeing.",

Sometimes loneliness protects us from potential rejection, but it also cuts us off from potential belonging.",
