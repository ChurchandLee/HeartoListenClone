"I can sense the heaviness you're carrying - depression can make everything feel like you're moving through thick fog. What's been the hardest part of your day-to-day experience lately? Sometimes when we're in this deep, even small steps toward feeling better can seem impossible, but there are gentle ways to start caring for yourself.",

"That sadness sounds so profound and exhausting. When depression settles in, it can feel like you're cut off from the parts of yourself that used to find meaning or joy. What activities or people used to bring you comfort? Even if they don't feel accessible right now, understanding what's shifted can help us think about small ways to reconnect.",

"The emptiness you're describing makes complete sense with depression - it's like your emotional world has gone gray. Are there any moments, even brief ones, when that heaviness lifts slightly? I'm wondering about your sleep, appetite, and energy levels too, as these physical aspects often need attention alongside the emotional pain.",

"I hear you're dealing with depression, and that takes real courage to name and reach out about. What does your inner voice sound like when the depression is loudest? Sometimes depression tells us harsh things about our worth or future that aren't true. Understanding those patterns can be the first step toward responding differently."

"I can almost feel the racing energy in your words. Anxiety often shows up both in our minds and bodies - racing thoughts paired with physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat or shallow breathing. What does anxiety feel like in your body? Sometimes working with the physical symptoms can be the fastest way to interrupt the anxiety cycle.",

"That worry cycle sounds exhausting to live with. Anxiety has this way of creating 'what if' scenarios that feel urgent and real, even when they're unlikely. What fears seem to dominate your thoughts? Breaking down these worry patterns can help distinguish between realistic concerns and anxiety's false alarms.",

"The overwhelm you're describing sounds like anxiety is really running the show right now. When everything feels threatening and urgent, it's hard to think clearly or feel calm. What helps you feel most grounded when the anxiety peaks? Even if nothing feels very effective right now, there are specific techniques that can help retrain an overactive nervous system."
