When someone asks 'what should I do' after sharing suicidal thoughts, the most important first step is connecting with crisis professionals who are trained for exactly this situation.\n\nHave you been able to call the crisis line (988 in the US, 116 123 in the UK)?

                // BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) - Enhanced responses
                bpd: [
                    "BPD can create this intense emotional experience where everything feels magnified - love feels like ecstasy, rejection feels like death, and the fear of abandonment can be absolutely paralyzing. The way your emotions can shift so quickly and intensely isn't your fault; it's how your nervous system learned to protect you. What's feeling most overwhelming about your BPD symptoms right now?",
                    "Living with BPD often means feeling like you're 'too much' for everyone, including yourself. The emotional storms, the identity shifts, the way relationships can feel both desperately needed and terrifyingly fragile - it's exhausting. You're not broken; your brain just developed different patterns to survive difficult early experiences. Are you currently using any DBT skills, or is that something you're interested in exploring?",
                    "The chronic emptiness that comes with BPD can feel like there's a black hole inside you that nothing can fill. The splitting, the impulsivity, the way your sense of self can feel so unstable - these are symptoms of trauma responses, not character flaws. What would feel most supportive right now - validation, distraction, or maybe just someone to sit with you in this feeling?",
                    "BPD and loneliness can be such a devastating combination. The fear of abandonment can make you push people away before they can leave you, which then creates the very isolation you were trying to avoid. The emotional intensity means loneliness doesn't just feel sad - it can feel like you're dying from the emptiness. How has BPD been affecting your relationships and sense of connection?"
                ],

                // DEPRESSION - Multiple nuanced responses
                depression: [
                    "Depression can feel like you're trapped underwater while everyone else is breathing normally above the surface. That heaviness, the exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix, the way everything loses its color and meaning - it's not weakness, it's illness. What does today feel like for you - is it a barely-surviving day or something different?",
                    "The way depression lies to you is so cruel - it tells you things will never get better, that you're a burden, that nothing matters. But depression thoughts aren't facts, even when they feel absolutely convincing. You're dealing with a medical condition that affects every aspect of functioning. What's been the hardest part about getting through each day lately?",
                    "Depression can make you feel like you're living in grayscale when everyone else sees in color. The cognitive fog, the way making decisions feels impossible, how you can logically know people care about you but not feel it - all of this is real and valid. Are there any tiny sparks of anything - curiosity, comfort, even just neutral moments - that you've noticed lately?",
                    "That depression fatigue is so real - when your brain is fighting a constant battle against itself, of course you're exhausted. Simple tasks feel like climbing mountains because your mind is working overtime just to function. You're not lazy or weak; you're dealing with an illness that saps energy in ways people can't see. How are you being gentle with yourself through this?"

                // ANXIETY - Comprehensive responses
                anxiety: [
                    "Anxiety can feel like your nervous system is stuck in emergency mode even when you're safe. That constant scanning for threats, the way your body reacts with racing heart and sweating to situations your logical brain knows aren't dangerous - it's exhausting to live in that state of hypervigilance. What tends to trigger your anxiety most?",
                    "The 'what if' thoughts can spiral so quickly with anxiety, creating entire catastrophic scenarios that feel completely real and urgent. It's like your brain's alarm system is so sensitive that it goes off for everything - real dangers and imagined ones alike. What's your anxiety telling you right now, and how much do you believe it versus knowing it's the anxiety talking?",
                    "Anxiety can make you feel like you're constantly bracing for impact, even when there's nothing coming at you. The physical symptoms - tight chest, racing thoughts, that sick feeling in your stomach - can be just as exhausting as the mental part. Have you found anything that helps you feel more grounded when the anxiety gets overwhelming?",
                    "Living with anxiety often means your mind is always three steps ahead, imagining everything that could go wrong. It takes so much energy to fight your own nervous system all day. The irony is that anxiety developed to protect you, but now it might be protecting you from things that aren't actually threats. How are you feeling in your body right now?"

                // ADHD - Multiple perspectives
                adhd: [
                    "ADHD can feel like living in a world designed for a completely different type of brain. The executive dysfunction, time blindness, rejection sensitivity - and the way your brain either hyperfocuses on the 'wrong' things or can't focus at all. It's not about being lazy or not trying hard enough; your brain just processes information and motivation differently. What aspect of ADHD is making life feel particularly challenging today?",
                    "The ADHD struggle with consistency is so real - your brain craves stimulation and novelty, but the world demands routine and structure. The way criticism can feel devastating due to rejection sensitivity, and how impulsivity can lead to decisions you later regret, can create such a cycle of shame. Are you feeling frustrated with the challenges right now, or have you been celebrating any of the unique strengths ADHD brings?",
                    "Having ADHD often means feeling like you're constantly swimming upstream while others are walking on land. The way tasks that seem simple to others can feel overwhelming, how your brain can solve complex problems but forget to eat lunch - it's a real neurological difference, not a personal failing. What strategies have you found that work with your brain instead of against it?",
                    "ADHD can significantly impact relationships and work because the symptoms - like interrupting, forgetting commitments, being late, or struggling with organization - can be misinterpreted as not caring. The rejection sensitivity makes any criticism feel devastating. How has ADHD been affecting your relationships and work life lately?"
                ],

                // AUTISM - Understanding responses
                autism: [
                    "Being autistic in a neurotypical world can be incredibly exhausting - constantly masking, trying to interpret social cues that don't come naturally, dealing with sensory overwhelm. It takes enormous energy to navigate a world that wasn't designed for your neurotype. What's been most challenging about being autistic lately?",
                    "Autism brings both incredible strengths and significant challenges. The deep focus and expertise in special interests, attention to detail, and authentic way of being are beautiful aspects of autism. But the social exhaustion, sensory issues, and need for routine in an unpredictable world can be overwhelming. How are you taking care of your sensory and social needs right now?",
                    "The autistic experience of feeling like you're constantly translating between your natural way of being and what the neurotypical world expects can be so tiring. Stimming, special interests, and need for routine aren't problems to be fixed - they're part of how your brain works best. Are you in environments where you can be authentically yourself?",
                    "Autism can affect social relationships because neurotypical social rules often don't make intuitive sense, and the energy required for masking can be exhausting. The sensory overwhelm and need for routine can also impact work and daily life in ways others might not understand. How has being autistic been affecting your daily functioning and relationships?"
                ],

                // PTSD/TRAUMA
                ptsd: [
                    "PTSD can make you feel like you're stuck in a nightmare that your brain won't let you wake up from. The flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, and emotional numbing are your nervous system's way of trying to protect you from perceived threats, even when you're safe. What's been most difficult about living with these trauma responses?",
                    "Trauma can rewire your brain and make the world feel perpetually unsafe, even in situations that logically you know are fine. The way PTSD affects sleep, relationships, and daily functioning shows how deeply trauma impacts every aspect of life. Are you currently getting any trauma-specific treatment like EMDR or trauma-focused therapy?",
                    "Living with PTSD often means feeling like you're constantly on guard, scanning for danger that may not even be there. The exhaustion from hypervigilance, coupled with intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors, can make you feel trapped in your own mind. What triggers tend to be most challenging for you right now?",
                    "PTSD can make relationships feel dangerous because trauma often involves betrayal of trust. The hypervigilance, emotional numbing, and triggers can make it hard to connect with others, even when you desperately want to. How has PTSD been affecting your ability to trust and connect with others?"

                loneliness: [
                    "Loneliness can feel so much heavier than just 'being alone' - it's that deep ache of missing connection, understanding, or feeling truly seen by someone. That sense of being invisible even when surrounded by people can be incredibly isolating. What's making the loneliness feel particularly intense right now?",
                    "There's something uniquely painful about loneliness - it can make you feel like you're the only person in the world experiencing life this way. The longing for someone who truly gets you, who you can be completely authentic with, is such a fundamental human need. What kind of connection are you missing most?",
                    "Loneliness has this way of making everything else feel more difficult - like you're carrying this invisible weight that no one else can see or understand. It's not about being needy or dramatic; it's about a basic human need for connection that isn't being met right now. How long have you been feeling this way?",
                    "The ache of loneliness can feel endless sometimes - like you're reaching out into the void and no one is reaching back. But you reaching out here, sharing this with me, shows incredible courage even when you're struggling. What would meaningful connection look like for you right now?"

                overwhelmed: [
                    "Feeling overwhelmed is like having too many browser tabs open in your mind - everything is running at once and it's slowing down your whole system. When everything feels urgent and important, it can be paralyzing because you don't know where to start. What's contributing most to feeling overwhelmed right now?",
                    "That overwhelmed feeling can be suffocating - like the walls are closing in and there's not enough air. When your capacity is maxed out, even small things can feel like the last straw. It's not about being weak; sometimes life just throws more at us than anyone should handle alone. What would it look like to give yourself permission to not handle everything perfectly?",
                    "Being overwhelmed often means you're carrying too much, caring too much, or trying to control too much - and all of those come from good places in your heart, even if they're exhausting you. The feeling of being scattered in a million directions while also feeling stuck is particularly tough. What's one small thing you could let go of, even temporarily?",
                    "Burnout can make you feel like you're running on empty while still being expected to perform at full capacity. The emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and feeling like nothing you do makes a difference can be soul-crushing. What area of your life is causing the most overwhelm right now?"

                motivation: [
                    "Sometimes motivation feels like this elusive thing that everyone else seems to have figured out, but you're sitting there waiting for it to show up. The truth is, motivation often comes after action, not before - even tiny steps can create momentum. What's one small thing you could do today that would feel like moving forward?",
                    "When motivation is low, it can feel like you're stuck in quicksan
